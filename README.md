# Foraging-Kentucky
## Capstone Project for Code:You Software Development Pathway

## Built by Ryan Cornett

### Project Description
This is a Blazor Server App that allows users to add wild edible food items (nuts, fruit, mushrooms, vegetables) for foraging to a database, view existing items, and note discovery of items in season. In addition to the features below, I met the requirements for visual appeal, incorporated a database to persist data, and wrote more than the minimum of three methods.

### Features List
 - *Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program* (optional feature #1). ItemOptions.cs <<LINE NUMBER>> contains a list used throughout the app. 
 - *Comments in the code explaining how I employ the SOLID principles Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)* (optional feature #2). <<FILE.CS AND LINE NUMBERS>> 
 - *Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format* (optional feature #3). <<FILE.CS AND LINE NUMBERS>> 
 - *Have 2 or more tables (entities) in your application that are related and have a function return data from both entities. In entity framework, this is equivalent to a join* (optional feature #4). <<FILE.CS AND LINE NUMBERS>> 

### How to Run 
 - Restore NuGet packages
 - In Powershell, enter *dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate*
 - Then enter *dotnet ef database update* 
 - On building, *foraging-kentucky.db* will be created on your desktop (if running on a Mac, check ForageContext.cs to ensure the path works)
 - You might have to change the build from *https* to *http* to run the app in your browser
 - Use some or all of these suggested Items, Users, or Recipes to interact with the app/database:
    - #### Items
    - 
    - #### Users
    - 
    - #### Recipes 
    -
